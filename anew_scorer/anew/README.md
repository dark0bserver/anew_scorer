# ANEW Score files.
The files to power the scorer come from the ["Affective norms for English words (ANEW): Instruction manual and affective ratings"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.306.3881&rep=rep1&type=pdf) MM Bradley, PJ Lang - 1999 paper.

The score files in this repo were simply copied from: https://tomlee.wtf/2010/06/16/anew/ (direct link for those in a hurry: https://tomlee.wtf/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/anew-1999.tar.gz).
